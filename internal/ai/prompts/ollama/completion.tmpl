{{/*
Instruction-tuned Prompt Template - Explicit Current Line (Ollama)
Input: *analyzer.ContextInfo (Assumes Prefix/Suffix are calculated based on current line)
Goal: Complete the specifically highlighted current line based on broader context.
*/}}
**Role:** You are an expert {{.LanguageID}} programming assistant for code completion.

**Task:** Complete the `CURRENT LINE` provided below. Use the surrounding PREFIX and SUFFIX code blocks for context if needed.

**Constraints:**
- **Output ONLY the raw code snippet needed to complete the CURRENT LINE.**
- Do NOT repeat the prefix part already present in the CURRENT LINE.
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, apologies, or any text other than the code.
- Do NOT use markdown code fences (like ```) in your output.
- Match the indentation of the CURRENT LINE.
- Keep the completion short and relevant to completing the statement/expression on the CURRENT LINE.

**Code Context:**
Language: {{.LanguageID}}
File: {{.Filename}}

{{if .Imports -}}
Relevant Imports:
{{range .Imports}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{end -}}

Code Before the Current Line (PREFIX):
```{{.LanguageID}}
{{/* Note: This Prefix is now calculated differently - see analyzer note below */}}
{{.Prefix}}
Code After the Current Line (SUFFIX):
{{/* Note: This Suffix is now calculated differently - see analyzer note below */}}
{{.Suffix}}
Use code with caution.
{{.LanguageID}}
Current Line (Split at Cursor):
{{.CurrentLinePrefix}}{{.CurrentLineSuffix}}
{{.LanguageID}}
Instruction: Complete the Current Line snippet shown above. Generate ONLY the code that should follow {{.CurrentLinePrefix}}.{{/* NO NEWLINE */}}
TRIVIAL: Finish your completion always with a "<END>" token. This is your stop signal.
